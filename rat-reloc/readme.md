This crate is a part of [rat-salsa][refRatSalsa].

* [Changes](https://github.com/thscharler/rat-salsa/blob/master/rat-reloc/changes.md)

# Rat-Reloc(ate)

This crate defines the trait
[RelocatableState](https://docs.rs/rat-reloc/latest/rat_reloc/trait.RelocatableState.html)

# Why?

Many widgets in rat-widget store one or more areas for mouse interaction.

And there are widgets that render other widgets to a temp Buffer and later
dump parts of it to the main render Buffer. And then all the stored areas
in the widget-state are wrong.

The RelocatableState trait gives the widgets that use such temp Buffers
a hook to correct for any movement and clipping that has happened.

# Why so complicated?

* This doesn't affect normal rendering of a widget, it's just
  and afterthought.
* The widget doesn't need to know what other widgets exist,
  it just has to provide the function to relocate its areas
  after rendering.
