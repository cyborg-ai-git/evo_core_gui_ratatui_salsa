After writing my first ratatui application I was intrigued with how nice the UI rendering worked.

But when I tried to do more I was soon sobered up by the lack of general purpose  widgets and infrastructure for a bigger app. 

So I started rat-salsa to fill the gaps.
And never anticipated how much work that would be :-o
