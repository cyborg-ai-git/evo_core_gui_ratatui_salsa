I wrote my first ratatui application, which was monitoring
changed files, recalculated the universe and showed potential
errors. That worked fine, and I got more ambitious.

Write a real UI for the cmd-line application I need for my day
to day work. And that quickly stalled, with quite a few bits and
pieces missing.

So I started this rat-salsa thing, to add a bit of spicy sauce
to my ratatouille.
