## TextInput

Single line text input widget. 

## TextArea

Textarea with tendencies to being an editor.

Uses [Rope](https://docs.rs/ropey/) backend for a good editing
experience for longer text. Starts lagging a bit if you have
more than 10,000 style ranges or so (wip). 

* Tab width/Tab expand to space.
* Indent/dedent selection.
* Newline starts at indent.
* Mouse selection can work word-wise. 
* Renders this text in ~400Âµs
* Quote/Brace/Bracket selection.

There is an extended example `mdedit.rs` for TextArea in 
<https://github.com/thscharler/rat-salsa>


## MaskedInput

Single line text input with a text-mask for allowed input.

* Numeric 
* Decimal/Hexadecimal/Octal digits
* Character/Character+Digits
* Text separators

Nice to have for structured text input.

use this as base.
