* [rat-focus](https://docs.rs/rat-focus/latest/rat_focus/): Focushandling for widgets.
* [rat-scrolled](https://docs.rs/rat-scrolled/latest/rat_scrolled/): Widgets for scrolling.
* [rat-input](https://docs.rs/rat-input/latest/rat_input/): Collection of widgets, but kept at a baseline level.
* [rat-ftable](https://docs.rs/rat-ftable/latest/rat_ftable/): Table widget for large data-sets.
