# Rat-Event

## Why?

This crate defines the trait [HandleEvent](HandleEvent) to help with
composability of event-handling for ratatui widgets.

Objectives are

- work for all event-types.
- allow for multiple handlers per widget
    - to override the key-bindings
    - to have different key-bindings for certain scenarios.
- have a return type to indicate what state change occured.

```rust ignore
pub trait HandleEvent<Event, Qualifier, Return>
where
    Return: ConsumedEvent
{
    fn handle(
        &mut self,
        event: &Event,
        qualifier: Qualifier
    ) -> Return;
}
```

## Event

Can be anything.

## Qualifier

There are predefined qualifiers

* [Regular](Regular) - Do what is considered 'normal' behaviour.
  Can vary depending on the actual state of the widget
  (e.g. focus)

* [MouseOnly](MouseOnly) - Splitting off mouse interaction helps when
  you only want to redefine the key bindings. And handling
  mouse events is usually more involved/complicated/specific.

* [DoubleClick](DoubleClick) - Double clicks are a bit special for widgets,
  often it requires a distinct return type and it's not
  as generally needed as other mouse behaviour.

* [Popup](Popup) - Popup event-handlers are regular event-handlers,
  but they need processing before regular event-handlers.
  This is used for widgets that render popups above other widgets,
  and must make sure that event-handling for the popup doesn't
  interfere with widgets below the popup. By ensuring the order
  of event-handling most of the problems can be solved.

* [Dialog](Dialog) - Specialized event-handler for dialog-like
  popups. They want to be called first to be able to consume
  **all** events, thus blocking everything else.

## Return

The return type can be anything too.

To be useful it is required to implement
[ConsumedEvent](ConsumedEvent) to indicate if the event has been
handled by the widget and further event-handling can stop.

To set a baseline for the return type this crate defines the enum
[Outcome](Outcome) which can indicate if a render is necessary or not.

> For interop all return types in rat-salsa are convertible
> to/from Outcome.

> There is one constraint for the return type: It must implement
> Consumed to indicate the fundamental property of an event being
> consumed by a widget. This lib has some control-flow constructs
> that use this property.
